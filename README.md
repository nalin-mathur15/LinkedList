# C++ Linked List Implementation

This project implements a basic singly linked list data structure in C++. 

**Purpose:**

* **Learn about memory management:** 
    * Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`.
    * Understanding memory leaks and how to prevent them.
* **Gain familiarity with data structures:**
    * Implement core linked list operations: 
        * Insertion (append)
        * Concatenation of two linked lists 
        * Displaying the linked list
        * Deletion of the entire linked list
* **Improve C++ programming skills:**
    * Practice object-oriented programming concepts (class, objects, methods).
    * Work with pointers and references.

**Project Structure:**

* `index.cpp`: Contains the main `LinkedList` class implementation and the `main` function with example usage. 

**To Build and Run:**

1. **Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).**
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
3. **Navigate to the project directory.**
4. **Compile the code:** 
   ```bash
   g++ index.cpp -o linked_list
